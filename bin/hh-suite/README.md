[ ![Codeship Status for soedinglab/hh-suite](https://codeship.com/projects/0936c290-2248-0133-bcb4-52bb0fef976f/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/96085)

[ ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soedinglab/hh-suite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soedinglab/hh-suite)

The HH-suite is an open-source software package for sensitive protein sequence searching based on the pairwise alignment of hidden Markov models (HMMs).

## WARNING ##
We had to rename our repository for ffindex, so it might be necessary to run the following commands to update the submodule in your clone:

	git pull
	git submodule deinit
	git submodule init


## Requirements

To compile from source, you will need:
 * a recent C/C++ compiler
 * [CMake](http://cmake.org/) 2.8.12 or later
 * install [pdbx python library](https://github.com/soedinglab/pdbx)


## Installation
We recommend compiling HHsuite on the machine that should run the computations so that it can be optimized for the appropriate CPU architecture.

### Packages
Some distributions incorporate HHsuite on their own:
* Ubuntu/Debian/etc. [DPKGs](http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/hhsuite) are provided by Laszlo Kajan.
* For Archlinux you can find a [PKGBUILD on aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hhsuite/)

### Release tarballs
The [release tarballs](http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/data/hhsuite/releases/) should contain all required source files. Simply download and extract

### Cloning from GIT
If you want to compile the most recent version, simply clone the git repository. Then, from the repository root, initialize the ffindex submodule:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update


### Compilation
With the sourcecode ready, simply run cmake with the default settings and libraries should be auto-detected:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASE_DIR} ..
	make
	make install


### Setting paths

#### Setting environment variables
In your shell set environment variable HHLIB to ${INSTALL\_BASE\_DIR}, e.g (for bash, zsh, ksh):

	export HHLIB=${INSTALL_BASE_DIR}

HHsearch and HHblits look for the column state library file cs219.lib
and the context library file context_data.lib in ${HHLIB}/data/. The HHsuite
scripts also read HHLIB to locate the perl modules Align.pm and HHPaths.pm
in ${HHLIB]/scripts/.  

Add the location of HHsuite binaries and scripts to your search PATH variable

	export PATH=${PATH}:${INSTALL_BASE_DIR}/bin:${INSTALL_BASE_DIR}/scripts


#### Specify BLAST, PSIPRED, PDB, DSSP paths

Specify paths in ${INSTALL\_BASE\_DIR}/scripts/HHPaths.pm where they are read by HHsuite's perl scripts.


### Download Databases
Download current databases from our [server](http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/data/hhsuite/databases/hhsuite_dbs/)
To build up multiple sequences alignments using HHblits uniprot20 is sufficient.


## Usage
For performing a single search iteration of HHblits, run HHblits with the
following command:

	hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -n 1 -d <database-basename>

For generating an alignment of homologous sequences:

	hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -oa3m <result-alignment> -d <database-basename>

You can get a detailed list of options for HHblits by running HHblits with the "-h" option.

## Building packages for a release
It might be good to do the following steps in a fresh VM with Ubuntu.
1. Adjust `/README.md` (see TODOs)
	The following line has to be updated

    <pre>
  		HHsuite for sensitive sequence searching version <b>current_version</b> (<b>release_date</b>)
    </pre>

1. Adjust `/CMakeLists.txt`
	1. Update the version number

			set (HHSUITE_VERSION_MAJOR 3)
			set (HHSUITE_VERSION_MINOR 0)
			set (HHSUITE_VERSION_PATCH 3)

	1. Update the release date

			set (HHSUITE_DATE "14-07-2017")

	1. Check the package version

  			set (CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "${HHSUITE_VERSION_MAJOR}")

		The beta is required for the current beta releases

  			set (CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "${HHSUITE_VERSION_MINOR}-beta")
  			set (CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "${HHSUITE_VERSION_PATCH}")

1. Build the packages

        rm -rf build
        mkdir build
        cd build

        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/mmeier/opt/hh-suite -DHAVE_SSE2=1 \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
        -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE=-static -static-libgcc \
        -static-libstdc++ -DCMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES=.a ..

        make -j 16
        make package
        make package_source

The generated packages can be found in /build

## TODO
- Build README.md with cmake to update release version and release date (compare to src/hhsuite_config.h.in)
